            <h4 class="origine2">
                The origin of the word ikigai goes back to the Heian period (794 to 1185). “The term has a long history, appearing as far back as the fourteenth-century Taiheiki, as well as in such early twentieth-century works as Natsume Sōseki’s 1912. novel Kōjin;
                but the contemporary Japanese works on ikigai that I’ve studied say little about the history of the term or about ikigai as conceived in the past.
                <br>
                <br> Okinawa, the southern island off of mainland Japan, is home to one of the highest ratios of centenarians to population. Okinawa is also a hotbed of ikigai ideology. Here the mild weather, healthy diet, and low level of stress are
                also factors, but it’s the island’s active population of non-retiring, purpose-driven residents that links them to other long-living communities in Sardinia, Italy and Icaria, Greece.
